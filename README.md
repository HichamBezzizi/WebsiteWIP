# Mashrou' Leila

![Website](./img/mashrouleila.png)

A website that I've built from scratch which I am currently still working on. The website showcases Mashrou' Leila, a four member indie rock bank from Lebanon.

[This website inspired me to make one of my own](http://mashrouleila.com/?page_id=57)

## Mission

- Solidify my knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Practice my HTML structure
- Practice using CSS
- Practice Responsive web design (still working on that.)

## What did I learn from this

1. Learned Progressive Enhancement: first structure (HTML) and then styling/animations (CSS).
1. Selecting the right HTML elements in my CSS to manipulate

## What was the most challenging

Since I was building this website from scratch, it was most challenging how I was going to structure my website, the design, what to add in terms of images, videos etc.

## Goal

I will keep working on this website to improve my knowledge of responsive web design and also to build it further.
