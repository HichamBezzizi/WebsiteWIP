            <p class="aboutText">Mashrou' Leila is a Lebanese four-member indie rock band. <br> The band formed in Beirut, Lebanon in 2008 as a music workshop at the American University of Beirut. <br> The band has released four studio albums: Mashrou' Leila (2009), Raas√ºk (2013), Ibn El Leil (2015) and The Beirut School (2019); and an EP , El Hal Romancy (2011), <br>while causing many controversies due to their satirical lyrics and themes.</p>

            <h1 class ="albumTitle">Hottest Album</h1>
            <p class ="albumText">The first hint of new material arrived when the band started a campaign asking the members of their social media pages to submit lyrics and video ideas to be incorporated in the band's upcoming single. "3 Minutes" was released on March 17, 2015. <br> The band experimented with drum machines, loops, samples, and several synthesisers in a new method of composition, trying to accommodate for the departure of keyboard player Omaya Malaeb. <br> "Maghawir" narrates a possible version of a club shooting in Beirut, drawing on references to real Lebanese case histories from two different shootings that took place within the same week, both of which resulted in the deaths of extremely young victims, each of who was out celebrating their birthday." <br> The album is heavily loaded with allusions and references, both to contemporary figures of pop, and to mythological figures of gods and demons.</p>
